- **Individual Developers:** ~$240/year (GitHub Copilot only if paying)
- **Teams:** Contact your team lead for organization-level pricing

---

## 6. AI CLI Tool Installation

Our team uses two primary command-line tools: `opencode` for structured coding and `gemini` for planning and coordination.

> **Quick path:** For a fast ~10-minute setup, follow the **[AI CLI Tools: Quick Start Guide](./AI-installation-tutorial.md)**

### What is opencode?

opencode is a CLI tool that helps you execute complex coding tasks using AI agents. Our team uses it for:

- Code generation and refactoring
- Automated code reviews
- Multi-file editing
- Structured development workflows

> **Team philosophy:** opencode requires **manual and deliberate model selection**. Always choose a model based on the task at hand. See [Section 7](#7-model-selection-guide) for guidance.

### What is Gemini CLI?

Our team uses Gemini CLI for:

- Project planning and coordination
- Meeting summaries
- Jira/ticket management
- Strategic decision-making

> **Team philosophy:** Gemini uses **auto model selection** by default, which is sufficient for most planning tasks.

## 7. Model Selection Guide

Choosing the right model for the right task ensures better results and efficient resource usage. The table below reflects the team's **current model lineup** as of June 2026 — always cross-reference with [oh-my-opencode-models.md](../tooling/oh-my-opencode-models.md) for the latest updates.

### Decision Tree for Model Selection

```
What are you doing?

├─ Code Generation
│  ├─ Quick scripts/functions → Claude Haiku 4.5 (fastest)
│  ├─ Complex features → Claude Sonnet 4.6 or GPT-5
│  └─ Edge cases/tricky logic → Claude Opus 4.6
│
├─ Code Review
│  ├─ PR review → Claude Sonnet 4.6 (best balanced)
│  ├─ Quick check → Claude Haiku 4.5
│  └─ Architecture review → Claude Opus 4.6
│
├─ Debugging
│  ├─ Quick fix → Claude Haiku 4.5 (fastest)
│  ├─ Complex bug → Claude Sonnet 4.6
│  └─ System issue → Claude Opus 4.6 (most thorough)
│
└─ Planning/Coordination (Gemini CLI)
   └─ Use auto model selection (recommended)
```

### Model Comparison Table

| Model                 | Speed     | Cost     | Best For                         | Notes                                |
| --------------------- | --------- | -------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Claude Haiku 4.5**  | Very Fast | Cheapest | Quick tasks, search, prototyping | Best for high-volume, low-complexity |
| **Claude Sonnet 4.6** | Fast      | Moderate | Code review, everyday coding     | Team default for most tasks          |
| **Claude Opus 4.6**   | Slower    | Higher   | Complex features, architecture   | Use when Sonnet isn't enough         |

> **Note:** For non-Claude models (GPT, Gemini), refer to [oh-my-opencode-models.md](../tooling/oh-my-opencode-models.md) for current model strings and alternatives per agent role.

### Tips for Model Selection

1. **Start with Claude Sonnet 4.6** — it handles most tasks well
2. **Drop down to Haiku 4.5** for simple, fast jobs to save cost
3. **Step up to Opus 4.6** only when Sonnet falls short
4. **Monitor your API usage** to stay within budget
5. **Share findings** with your team about what works best per task type

## 8. Verification & Testing

Let's verify everything is working together.

### Complete System Check

Run these commands one by one:

```bash
# 1. Check Git
git --version

# 2. Check Node.js (expect v18+)
node --version

# 3. Check npm (expect v9+)
npm --version

# 4. Check VS Code
code --version

# 5. Check opencode
opencode --version

# 6. Check Gemini CLI
gemini --version

# 7. Verify opencode authentication
opencode auth status

# 8. Verify Gemini CLI authentication and usage
gemini usage
```

**Expected Results:**

- All version commands return version numbers at or above the required versions
- `opencode auth status` shows authenticated state
- `gemini usage` shows your current request count (e.g., "23/1500 requests today")

### Real Workflow Example

#### Example: Build a String Validator

**Step 1: Generate with Copilot (VS Code)**

- Create a new file: `validator.js`
- Write a comment: `// Function to validate email format`
- Let Copilot suggest the implementation

**Step 2: Review with opencode CLI**

```bash
opencode --model "claude-sonnet-4-6" "Review this JavaScript code for edge cases and security: [paste code]"
```

**Step 3: Plan Testing with Gemini CLI**

```bash
gemini chat "Create a test plan for an email validator function with these test cases: valid email, missing @, invalid domain"
```

#### Example: Coordinate Team on Feature

**Step 1: Plan with Gemini CLI**

```bash
gemini plan "We need to add two-factor authentication to our app. What are the steps?"
```

**Step 2: Generate Code with opencode**

```bash
opencode --model "claude-opus-4-6" "Generate a 2FA implementation using TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)"
```

**Step 3: Refine with Copilot**

- Open the generated code in VS Code
- Use Copilot Chat to add error handling and edge cases
